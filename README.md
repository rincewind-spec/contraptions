# contraptions

A demo Generative AI Flutter application. Unfortunately the Generate Description from Image button
does not work due to OpenAI screwing up on their promised multimodal API, and is disabled in the 
code. Inspired by a certain pharmacist-coded villain's many evil schemes (and many more to come, 
one would hope).

## Running the Project

You must input `flutter run -d chrom --web-renderer html` for web usage or else the project will not 
update with new generated images. You must also supply your own OpenAI API key.
